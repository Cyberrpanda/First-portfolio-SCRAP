                        <p>
                                                                                                                        
                            I started my education in ABBEY SCHOOLS in 9/11 Farayola St, Alapere Lagos Nigeria,
                            i completed my Nursery to primary two there. Then i had to 
                            change schools because of relocation, so i was transferred 
                            to ROLE MODEL SCHOOLS in Ikosi road Onigbongbo Lagos, 
                            Nigeria. There i was even given the post of assistant  
                            Social Prefect and it was there i completed my Primary school education.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            I began my Secondry school Education at Dansol High school in 13/15, 
                            Acme Cresent, Off Acme road, off Agidingbi Road, Agidingbi,Ikeja.
                            There i completed my Junior Secondary School Education. Then once 
                            again i changed schools and was enrolled in Babcock University 
                            High School in Ilishan Remo Ogun State where i completed my 
                            Senior Secondary School Education.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            I subsequently got admission into Babcock University and it is there i currently reside
                            as a 300 level Computer Science Student.
